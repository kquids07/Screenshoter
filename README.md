# Screenshoter
This Python app lets you set a custom screenshot hotkey like in games. Click “Set Hotkey”, then press any key to bind it. Pressing that key captures the full screen with mss, saves it in where you want :with a timestamp, copies it to the clipboard via Pillow, and plays a beep as feedback.
